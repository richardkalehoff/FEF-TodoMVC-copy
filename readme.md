# TodoMVC Demo App

This is a copy of the TodoMVC site. It's used as a demo app for the Front End Frameworks course by [Udacity](https://udacity.com). The real site appears all faded when doing tablet recordings, so I need to I need to darken all colors/shadows.

# Setup

* clone project
* `cd TodoMVC`
* start local server w/ `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* override real site by adding `127.0.0.1   todomvc.com` to `/etc/hosts`
* load [todomvc.com:8000](http://todomvc.com:8000)
